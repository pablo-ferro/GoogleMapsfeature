# Google Maps walking route prototype feature

#### I prototyped this new and climate-adapted feature for Google Maps to deal with heat waves and high UV sun exposure.

Introducing a new Google Maps' groundbreaking (a personal wish - prototype) feature that revolutionizes walking routes. Designed to protect individuals during heatwaves and minimize sun exposure, "Low UV option" analyzes real-time sun orientation and weather data to provide the optimal path while keeping you cool and safe. Say goodbye to UV issues and hello to a healthier society that can enjoy walking without worrying about high sun exposure.
